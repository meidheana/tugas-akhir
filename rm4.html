    <b> Introduction 
    </b>
    <br><br>
    Gyeongju Yangdong Village is Korea’s largest traditional village, showcasing the traditional 
    culture of the Joseon Dynasty and the beautiful natural surroundings. Thanks to its many cultural
     heritages, including treasures, national treasures, and folklore materials, the entire village has 
     been designated as a cultural heritage site. Many people have visited this village to see its wealth 
     of cultural heritages and scenic surroundings. Charles, Prince of Wales, visited this village in 1993. 
    <br><br>
    Seolchangsan Mountain and its four spines of mountains can be seen beyond the village. Approximately 160 old houses 
    and 500-year-old thatched-roof cottages are nestled within the valley. Fifty-four of these homes, 
    are over 200 years old and have been excellently preserved in their original state, offering a rare 
    opportunity to view a variety of unique Korean traditional houses in person.
